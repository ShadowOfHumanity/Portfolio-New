# Public Assets

This directory should contain the following assets:

## Images
- `placeholder.jpg` - Default placeholder for projects without images
- `project1.jpg` - Screenshot for JobsForMalta project
- `project2.jpg` - Screenshot for BUDGETER project
- `selfImage.jpg` - Profile photo

## Documents
- `Darian-Cv.pdf` - Frontend Developer CV
- `General-CV.pdf` - Technical CV

If these files are missing, the application has fallback mechanisms to prevent build failures, but you should add the actual assets for the best user experience.
